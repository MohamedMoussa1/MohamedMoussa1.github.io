Hi! I'm Mohamed Moussa, a recent graduate of Computer Science Software Engineering Specialist Co-op at the University of Toronto.

My first hands-on experience was in 2020: At Hack the Valley IV, where I worked with 3 developers to build and deploy a fully functional web application.
As this hackathon was my first step towards web development,
I continued to build upon the skills I learned and started to develop web applications with the MERN stack.

My latest work experience was in 2023: An 8 months Co-op work term at Verto Health as a Junior Full Stack Developer.
Through this experience I worked with Ruby on Rails, Angular, Vue, Python, Postgresql, and Kubernetes.

In my free time, I like to increase my knowledge on the latest technologies, compose music, play violin, piano, guitar, chess, ski and enjoy nature.

**Favourite Quote**:

_"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life,
and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.
And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking.
Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.
And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.
So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle." ~ Steve Jobs_
