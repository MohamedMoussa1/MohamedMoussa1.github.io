Hi! I'm Mohamed Moussa, a 4th year Computer Science Software Engineering Specialist Co-op student at the University of Toronto.

My first hands-on experience was at Hack the Valley IV, where I worked with 3 developers to build and deploy a fully functional web application.
As this hackathon was my first step towards web development,
I continued to build upon the skills I learned and can now develop web applications with the MERN stack.

My latest work experience was an 8 months Co-op work term at Verto Health as a Junior Full Stack Developer.
Through this experience I worked with Ruby on Rails, Angular, Vue, Python, Postgresql, and Kubernetes.

In my free time, I like to increase my knowledge on the latest technologies, compose music, play violin, piano, and guitar, and ski.
