Over 55% of seniors do not adhere to medication instructions.
Seniors tend to forget not only when to take their medications, but also which medicine to take.
This is a serious problem that can have a detrimental effect on them.
For example, forgetting to take the right medicines can lead to hallucinating, bleeding, and hospitalization.

Another problem is seniors are generally not tech savy. So, phone reminders can be complex for them to operate.
Also, not all seniors live with someone who can remind them to take their medications.

ReminDr solves the above issues; this application allows doctors to automatically send SMS notifications to patients.
A doctor would create a reminder, add the patient's phone number, name of the medicine, and instructions for medicine consumption.

All a patient needs is to give their phone number to their family doctor, and wait for their medicine SMS notification. This will avoid almost any technological complexity.
Also, having the notifications done by a professional, compared to a close relative with no medical background, would make seniors at more confident to take their medications.
