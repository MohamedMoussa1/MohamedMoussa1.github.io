During my 8 months workterm at Verto Health as a Junior Full Stack Developer, I had the opportunity to apply and expand my interpersonal and technical skills.
Through this period, I worked on a variety of frontend and backend tickets, tackling everything from bug resolutions to new features development.

Despite initially encountering unfamiliar tools, like Ruby on Rails, Angular, and Vue, I managed to quickly adapt and learn to integrate with the team.
Furthermore, I led the upgrades for these tools in order to maintain optimal performance, enhance functionality, and ensure compatibility with the latest industry standards.
This experience in upgrades provided me with invaluable insights about these tools.

In addition to the day-to-day frontend and backend tasks, I worked on other tasks that required a direct interaction with the Product team.
These tasks enhanced my ability to communicate with and effectively respond to queries of different teams.

Finally, I was able to express my curiosity about the bigger picture and how the dev team interacts with other teams.
I have always been interested to see how different teams work together to produce a finished software solution.

**Tools and Languages**: Ruby on Rails, Angular, Vue, Python, TypeScript, JSON, Github Actions CI, Kubernetes CD
