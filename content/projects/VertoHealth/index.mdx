In my Co-op work term at Verto Health, I have worked with Angular for the
first time. I managed to setup microfrontend projects in the frontend and seed
them accordingly from the backend. Furthermore, I have learned a lot about
Typescript and the usage of props. Also, I became proficient in making a page
responisve and the different ways to acquire responsiveness. For example, I
used bootstrap classes and media queries. I learned that bootstrap classes are
more maintable. Through these projects, I have explored Angular, Typescript,
and improved my CSS and design skills.In my Co-op work term at Verto Health, I have worked with Angular for the
