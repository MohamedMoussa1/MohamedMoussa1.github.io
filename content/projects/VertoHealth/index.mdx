During my 8 months Co-op at Verto as a Junior Full Stack Developer, I had the opportunity to work on diverse frontend and backend tickets. Through these tickets, I gathered lots of experience on different tools and working in a team.

One of the tasks I did through Ruby on Rails was utilizing Active Record database queries to extract Postgresql data and generating customized Excel reports. These reports were generated based on user input, including date range and filtering certain aspects of the data. Based on the required functionality, the reports were sent through email or downloaded on user click.

I have worked with Angular and Vue to create responsive UI components for a seamless user experience across diverse devices and screen sizes.

Furthermore, I have worked on upgrading tools such as Ruby, Rails, and Angular. The upgrading process provided me with valuable insights on these tools.

After getting familiar with these tools, I started to provide knowledge transfer to other developers and assist them with environment setup. Furthermore, I participated in code reviews and shared insights to identify and fix potential errors in order to maintain code quality and reduce future risks. Also, I contributed to CI and CD. For CI, I developed GitHub actions to automate necessary workflows. For CD, I worked on deploying branches to staging environments through Kubernetes.

Although being a part of the Development team, I directly engaged with other teams, such as the Product team, and effectively responded to their queries.

Another component of my tasks was writing documentation. With readers in mind, I authored comprehensive and organized documentation, designed for quick comprehension and effortless reference.

Overall, I was able to quickly adapt to the work environment at Verto and have shown eagerness to learn and grow.
