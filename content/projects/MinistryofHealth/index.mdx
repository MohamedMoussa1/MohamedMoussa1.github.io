Through my 8 months workterm with the Ministry of Health (MOH), I had the chance to work on many interesting projects, one of which was building an Azure pipeline to automate and enhance the analysis process of data residing in excel files.

Since it was my first experience with Azure and Cloud Architecture, I embarked a research journey to understand the required technologies and concepts. Through researching, I experimented with Azure, looked for different approaches to perform the required tasks, and provided progress reports, while working on other projects.

After hardwork and focus, the necessary foundations became in place. Excel files can now be automatically passed from SharePoint to the Blob, through Logic App, making the data ready to be hosted on Synapse.

Documenting the work I have done was also crucial for the next person to work on this project. I made sure that the documentation was thorough, concise, and guide developers on not only how to replicate the current work, but also propose possible implementations for the next steps with their advantages and disadvantages.
