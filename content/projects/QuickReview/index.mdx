It can be a challenge to find a restaurant to eat at when there are so many factors that
need to be considered. For instance, you may want to eat at a restaurant that is within walking
distance, has vegetarian options, is still open at midnight and has low prices.

The goal of QuickReview is to make it easy for regular users to find a restaurant to eat at based on their
unique preferences and filtering criteria. In addition, QuickReview can be used as a
business tool to help promote restaurants and thus increase sales.

A restaurant can establish a good reputation on our site by having good reviews and high ratings which will make regular
users more inclined to visit the restaurant.
