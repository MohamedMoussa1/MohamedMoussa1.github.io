After competing in Hack the Valley IV, I started to learn about web development in my own time.

Inspired by [Yelp](https://www.yelp.ca/toronto), YelpCamp was the project to apply this knowledge.

**Technologies**: NodeJS, MongoDB, Express, and Heroku

**Github**: [YelpCamp Repo](https://github.com/MohamedMoussa1/YelpCamp)

**Deployed**: [YelpCamp](https://safe-castle-93464.herokuapp.com/)

Choosing the right Campground for you can be very challenging.
Having a platform were you can view people's experience on different campgrounds will indeed facilitate your decision.
That is where YelpCamp comes to aid; furthermore, you can register on YelpCamp and contribute to this community!
